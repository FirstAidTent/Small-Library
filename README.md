# Small-Library
This is a java program I made for an assignment in one of my java courses in the University of Gothenburg. 

The program is made with the Swing interface. It extracts books from a book list in a file and stores it in an SQL database, which will then be displayed for the user. The program will also extract borrowers from another file and store them as well. When starting the program, it will then ask for borrower ID. If it finds the borrower ID in the database, the user will get access to the list of books stored in the database, which the user then can choose from to borrow books.
